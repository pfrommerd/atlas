# HVM Memory Layout

HVM represents every term as a 64-bit word. The same layout is used for dynamic
terms (mutable heap entries) and static terms (immutable book entries).

## Term Pointer Layout (64-bit)

```
SUB (1 bit) | TAG (7 bits) | EXT (16 bits) | VAL (40 bits)
```

- `SUB`: marks a substitution cell; ignored for immediates.
- `TAG`: constructor variant (APP, LAM, SUP, etc.).
- `EXT`: metadata (dup label, ctor/ref name, level, op code, flags).
- `VAL`: payload (heap loc, immediate, or 0).

## Substitution Cells (SUB Bit)

When a linked binder interacts (APP-LAM, DUP-*), its body or expr slot is
replaced by a substitution term with the SUB bit set. Any VAR/DP0/DP1 that
points to that heap location must read the substitution instead of the original
binder. This is how linked variables resolve their binders without extra maps.

## DUP Nodes vs DUP Terms

A DUP term is the syntactic binder `[expr, body]` with tag `DUP`. A DUP node is
the shared expr slot that DP0/DP1 point to; it has no body and no parent, and it
is substituted when a duplication interaction occurs.

## Linked vs Quoted Binders

Linked binders are dynamic lams/dups whose vars point to heap locations. Linked
LAM uses `EXT = level | flags` and its VARs point to the body slot. Linked DUP
uses DP0/DP1 vars that point to the shared expr slot.

Quoted binders are terms encoded with de Bruijn levels in `EXT` (and for BJ0/BJ1,
the dup label). Their variables are BJV/BJ0/BJ1 indices, so there are no heap
links and no interaction with APP-LAM or DUP-SUP.

During collapse, linked LAM/DUP binders are converted into quoted LAM/DUP
binders, and free VAR/DP0/DP1 become BJV/BJ0/BJ1 at the current level. This is
used to turn interaction nets into full lambda terms.

## Dynamic vs Static Terms

Dynamic terms live on the heap and are mutable: binders can be replaced
by substitutions, and DUP nodes evolve as duplication is forced. Static terms
live in the book and are immutable; they store de Bruijn levels and are never
updated in place.

Allocation (ALO) terms bridge the two: they reference a static book term and a
bind list, lazily expanding one layer into a dynamic term when forced. This
keeps static definitions compact while still allowing dynamic sharing during
execution.

### ALO Runtime Encodings

- `ALO` with `len == 0` (empty substitution list) is stored directly:
  - `ALO.val = book_term_loc`
  - no extra heap allocation for an ALO pair node.
- `ALO` with `len > 0` stores one packed ALO pair word at `ALO.val`:
  - `high 40 bits = bind list head location`
  - `low 24 bits  = book term location` (truncated static location)

This keeps `len > 0` ALO pairs at one heap word while preserving full 40-bit
dynamic locations for bind-list heads.

### Static Book Location Bound

Because packed ALO pairs store book term locations in 24 bits, static/book
allocation must fit in that range. After parsing, the runtime checks this bound
and reports an error if static locations exceed `2^24` words.

### ALO Bind-List Nodes

For `len > 0`, the bind list is a linked list of 2-slot nodes:

- `node[0]`: bound term cell (the substitution target term lives here).
- `node[1]`: `NUM(next_node_loc)`; `0` means end of list.

This means the pointer used by variables/copiers is the bind-node location
itself (slot `0`), not a separate allocation.

- In `ALO-LAM`, `node[0]` is the lambda body slot.
- In `ALO-DUP`, `node[0]` is the shared DUP expr slot.

## LAM Ext Flags

- `LAM_ERA_MASK` (0x8000): binder is unused in lambda body (erasing lambda).
